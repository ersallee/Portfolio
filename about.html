			<h2>About the Developer</h2>
			<p>
				Hi.  My name is Eric, and I'm a web developer.  This page is about my skills.  I have learned HTML5 and CSS3 will continue to learn those as they are the backbone of web development.  Next will be Javascript, which is a programming language that will make a website go from static to dynamic.
			</p>

			<p>
				Other skills of mine include C++, which is a lower level language than Javascript, in that it requires a compiler to make a program runnable on a computer system.  This is relatable to web deveopment because once you have learned a programming language and understand how they work, along with knowing how syntax is applied to various languages and then the complex commands such as if/for statements, then you can learn other languages without much difficulty.
			</p>

			<p>
				Other tools I use include mobile first design, which means the simplest format for a website is developed first due to the large number of mobile devices in use around the world, and then expand the complexity of the website for the larger screens such as desktop computers.
